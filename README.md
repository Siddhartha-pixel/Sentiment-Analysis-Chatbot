##Safe AI Voice Chatbot
This project is a mental health-focused chatbot application with a graphical user interface (GUI). Developed in Python, it uses sentiment analysis to provide emotionally aware conversational support and, in critical situations, sends an emergency SMS alert to a trusted contact.

##‚öôÔ∏è Features
Voice and Text Interaction: Users can communicate with the chatbot by typing or by speaking using their microphone. The system supports both voice input and text-to-speech output for natural interaction.

Sentiment Analysis: The chatbot analyzes user input to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. It then provides a tailored, supportive response based on the detected emotion.

Critical Keyword Detection: A predefined list of keywords related to self-harm and danger is used to identify and respond to high-risk situations immediately.

Emergency SMS Alert: In response to critical keywords, the application automatically sends a text message alert to a pre-configured trusted phone number using the Twilio API. This serves as an immediate intervention mechanism.

Accessibility & Usability: The GUI is built with CustomTkinter and includes features like "High Contrast" mode to improve readability and "Anonymous Mode" for user privacy.

Resource Suggestions: A dedicated button provides a list of mental health resources and helplines.
